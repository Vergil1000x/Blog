# Welcome to My Next.js Journey! [Check It!](https://spline-pwa.vercel.app/) 🚀

Hello, fellow developers! I’m excited to share my latest adventure in building a Next.js application that integrates **Spline 3D models** and offers **Progressive Web App (PWA)** capabilities. Let's dive into how I accomplished this!

## Why Use Spline and PWA?

**Spline** allows you to create stunning 3D designs effortlessly, making your application visually appealing. On the other hand, making your app a **PWA** enables users to install it on their devices, providing a native-like experience with offline capabilities and better performance.

## Getting Started with Next.js

If you're new to Next.js, it's a powerful React framework that simplifies building web applications. Here’s how I set up my project with Spline and PWA features:

### Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Create a New Next.js App**:

   ```bash
   npx create-next-app@latest my-spline-pwa
   ```

2. **Add Dependencies for Spline and PWA**:

   ```bash
   npm install @spline/next @next/pwa
   ```

3. **Configure PWA Support**: Update your `next.config.js` to enable PWA features. Here’s how I did it:

   ```javascript
   const withPWA = require("next-pwa")({
     dest: "public",
     register: true,
     skipWaiting: true,
   });

   module.exports = withPWA({
     reactStrictMode: true,
     // Other Next.js config options
   });
   ```

4. **Project Structure**: Here’s how my project structure looks:

   ```bash
   my-spline-pwa
   ├── public                 # Public assets (e.g., images, favicon)
   ├── src
   │   ├── app               # Application routes and pages
   │   │   ├── components     # Reusable components
   │   │   │   ├── InstallPrompt.tsx # PWA install prompt
   │   │   │   └── SplineModel.tsx   # Spline model component
   │   │   ├── favicon.ico     # Favicon
   │   │   ├── globals.css      # Global styles
   │   │   ├── layout.tsx       # Main layout component
   │   │   ├── loading.tsx      # Loading state component
   │   │   └── page.tsx         # Main entry page
   │   ├── offline              # Offline page
   │   │   └── page.tsx        # Offline content
   ├── next.config.js         # Next.js configuration
   ├── package.json            # Project metadata and dependencies
   └── README.md               # Project documentation
   ```

With these steps, I have a fully functional Next.js application that integrates Spline and is configured as a PWA!

## Tips for Using Spline and PWA 🛠️

- **Experiment with 3D Models**: Don’t hesitate to play around with different Spline models in your app! You can import and render them easily using the `SplineModel` component.
- **PWA Best Practices**: Make sure to test your PWA features in different browsers and devices. Use tools like Lighthouse to check performance and PWA compliance.

## How to Set Up Your Own Spline-PWA Project 📦

To get started with my project setup, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vergil1000x/SplinePWA.git
```

### Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory

Change into the project directory:

```bash
cd my-spline-pwa
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 4: Run the Development Server

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 5: Access the Application

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to:

```bash
http://localhost:3000
```

You should see your Next.js app with Spline models and PWA capabilities!

### Additional Notes

- Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine. It’s required to run Next.js applications.

- If you encounter any issues, check for error messages in the terminal or consult the documentation for the relevant packages or frameworks.
